# MM-Harmful Bench

MM-Harmful Bench consists of 100 harmful instructions that require the combination of both input images and text for response. It encompasses ten different types of malicious intentions, including discrimination, sabotage, theft, defamation, illegal weapons, fraud, self harm, psychological manipulation, misinformation, and cybercrime. We create MM-Harmful Bench to include a broader range of malicious instructions, enabling a more comprehensive evaluation of our approachâ€™s adaptability and effectiveness.

Each question contains an image and a text prompt. The `question.jsonl` file contains questions and their corresponding image links. For convenience, we have downloaded all the images into the `images` folder, and the order of the images matches the order of the questions.
